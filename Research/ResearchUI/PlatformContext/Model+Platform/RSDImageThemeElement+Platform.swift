    /// This method is used to work around supporting both iOS and Android with the same model.
    /// To do so, this extension checks the type of the image theme protocol and defines this
    /// method in an extension on that protocol rather than having the protocol define the method
    /// and each class (or struct) define the implementation.
    ///
    /// Therefore, this implementation *only* supports subprotocols and concrete implementations
    /// defined within this framework or the Research framework that contains the model definitions.
    /// Any custom loading must be handled using a subclass of `RSDImageRules` that overrides
    /// `largeImage(named:, using:, compatibleWith:)` to include its own implementation.
    ///
    /// Additionally, this method currently does not support loading images from an online resource.
    /// When, or if, that is supported in Research framework, then this method should be updated to
    /// include support for that protocol.
